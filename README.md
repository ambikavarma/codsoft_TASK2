features like genre, director, and actors.
The goal is to analyze historical movie data and develop a model
that accurately estimates the rating given to a movie by users or
critics.
Explored data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine
learning modeling techniques. It provides insights into the factors
that influence movie ratings and allows you to build a model that
can estimate the ratings of movies accurately.
